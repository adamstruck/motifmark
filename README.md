Draw a diagram showing where matches to a regex are located within 1 or more sequences.
Note: the sequence file must have the sequence identifier located in the 1st column. All other columns will be treated as sequence segments to be examined. <br>

The command line switches are:     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp -i   name of sequence file (tab-delimited)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp -m   name of file containing motifs to match (assume header)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp -o   label for output files (\.pdf will be appended)
